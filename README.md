# Intro
- A simple duolingo bot

- The login code is highly dependant on reCAPTCHA failing to identify the bot, so if your IP has a low score, it is unlikely to work 100% of the time

- This is an educational project, _**do not use this to violate duolingo TOS**_

# Usage
1. install selenium:
``` pip3 install selenium```
2. install firefox: https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox/new/
3. run duoBot.py (be patient lots of waits are present) in python3
4. in terminal input your details
